# CbTan

In this project we expand the analysis of CbTan, an enzyme family previously characterised by A. Sörensen et al. 

## Motivation

In the study by A. Sörensen et al. they showed destinct difference in substrate preference by the different Tan enzymes. In this work we intend to expand the structural analysis of this enzyme family by incorporating 260 structures predicted by alphafold from homologus sequences. 

## Analysis

### Predicting structures from sequences using Alphafold

We use alphafold to predict 5 structures for each of the 260 sequences. Of the five structures generated we keep the one with the highest average plddt score as predicted by alphafold. The model/structures from alphafold was subsequently relaxed which yealded the structures used for further analysis.

#### Structures that faled prediction in alphafold
Alphafold failed to generate structures for four of the 260 sequences. 

#TODO: Identify sequences tht failed.

#### plddt analysis
